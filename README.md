# PIXY
It's a simple drawing program which I developed as a hobby project, after I learned Java in Uni. It uses Java Swing and support features like auto-filling, color mixing, random color generation and many others.

## Installation

Clone, or download this repository in an "src" folder, then you can import your favorit IDE (such as IntelliJ or Eclipse). It can find the main class (drawing) and capable to build and run to program.
